# The Road Network of Crete
Modelling the road network of crete in the context of complex networks.

## Abstract
In this project we've constructed the road network of the biggest Greek island, Crete, as a spatial graph and analyzed its statistical properties and its structure. Doing so we found by using different metrics which node is most important in the network. Our initial question and motivation was to see if the network could be optimized in order to provide faster transportation between the nodes. But this is left for a future study. The main question we attempted to answer was if the road network of Crete is random, and by random we meant with a structure or properties close to that of the Erdos-Renyi random network.

The images produced from the cretan network and of the Erdos-Renyi network, suggest that the cretan network is not a random network.
